# T9
A keypad for predictive text, based on tree data structures and binary search, which was developed during my MSc 
in the University of Birmingham.


This is a project for using tree data structures and binary search to create a T9 predictive text system, resembling the keypad of older mobile phones.


Different data structures and searching algorithms were used to finalise this application.

The application was designed by using Java Swing.
